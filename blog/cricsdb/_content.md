[CricsDB](https://t20.rahuldave.com/) is a T20 cricket analytics
platform I built around the wonderful open data from
[cricsheet.org](https://cricsheet.org). It covers **12,940 matches**
across international cricket and 18 club leagues, **2.95 million
ball-by-ball deliveries**, and **160K wickets** — all queryable via a
React frontend with deep-linkable URLs.

## What you can do with it

- Browse **teams** with split men's/women's stats, head-to-head records,
  and per-season trajectories.
- Drill into **batters** and **bowlers** — by innings, by over, by phase
  (powerplay / middle / death), by season, by opponent, with dismissal
  breakdowns.
- Look up any **head-to-head** matchup between a batter and a bowler
  across the entire dataset.
- Browse **matches** and open a **scorecard** with worm chart, Manhattan
  chart, and a per-delivery innings grid that colors every ball by
  outcome.

## The stack

- **Database** — SQLite (435 MB, WAL mode) accessed through
  [deebase](../deebase/), a small async ORM I'd been working on.
- **Backend** — FastAPI, async, raw parameterised SQL via
  `db.q(sql, params)`. The bind-parameter support was a small
  [PR back to deebase](https://github.com/rahulcredcore/deebase/pull/8).
- **Frontend** — React 19 + TypeScript + Tailwind v4, charts in
  [Semiotic v3](https://github.com/nteract/semiotic), build via Vite 8.
- **Deploy** — [pla.sh](https://pla.sh), single-command deploys with the
  database persisted on the host between code-only pushes.

## Design notes

A handful of small decisions ended up shaping the whole project.

**Over numbering: 0-indexed in the DB, 1-indexed in the API.** Cricsheet
stores overs as 0–19, so the database stays faithful to the source. The
API adds 1 before returning, so consumers see 1–20 everywhere. The
mental cost is one `+1` in each router; the win is that joins against
cricsheet always line up.

**Legal balls vs all deliveries.** Batting strike rate counts only legal
balls (no wides, no no-balls). Bowling runs-conceded counts *all*
deliveries because the bowler is charged for the extras. Mixing these
two up is the single most common bug in amateur cricket dashboards;
isolating them in two separate SQL paths kept the rest of the codebase
honest.

**URL is the source of truth.** Every page's filter, tab, and selected
player lives in `?search=params`. A custom `useSetUrlParams()` hook does
atomic multi-param updates so the back button always lands somewhere
sensible and any view is a copy-pasteable link.

**Wisden-almanack visual identity.** The first cut was generic Tailwind
— blue/grey, Inter, default shadows. Functional, forgettable. The
redesign pass swapped in a cream page (`#FAF7F0`), warm dark-brown ink,
oxblood as the only accent, and Fraunces for display type. No card
chrome — hierarchy comes from rules, whitespace, and typography. Two
files in the entire frontend contain raw color literals; everything
else references named tokens.

## Things I learned

- **Semiotic v3** is a lovely chart library but the high-level
  `Scatterplot` helper doesn't expose per-point click handlers — to wire
  scatter↔table linking in both directions you have to drop down to
  `XYFrame` directly.
- **Identity ambiguity is the hardest problem in a sports database.**
  ~110 team names appear in *both* men's and women's matches in
  cricsheet (every international side, every IPL/WPL franchise pair…).
  A team page with no gender filter aggregating both squads is
  statistically meaningless. The fix is contextual: when a tournament
  filter is set, auto-fill the gender; when it isn't, show a banner.
- **Double-encoded JSON** snuck into one column (`wicket.fielders`)
  because both my import script *and* deebase's JSON column type called
  `json.dumps`. The matches scorecard router still parses twice as a
  workaround; the real fix is a five-line diff plus a 15-minute DB
  rebuild.

## What's next

A mechanically-generated ball-by-ball commentary tab on the scorecard
page is the next big feature — cricsheet doesn't ship editorial prose,
but the structured data is rich enough to render `19.6 — Bumrah to
Kohli — 4 runs (FOUR)` style feeds, linked bidirectionally to the
innings grid.

Run it locally, file an issue, or just go look up your favourite
