# GPR: Gest Promote

Use when work should become externally visible on GitHub.

## Promotion Criteria

Promote durable user-visible, architecture-relevant, multi-session,
release-worthy, or externally trackable work. Do not promote every leaf task.

For every development depth-1 parent and every development iteration close, an
explicit `gpr` decision is required. Either create/sync the GitHub issue and
store metadata, or record why the work is staying local. Do not silently skip
GitHub issue integration for development work.

## Workflow

1. Read the Gest task/iteration/spec.
2. Sanitize internal details: remove Gest IDs, implementation-only paths, and
   private workflow notes.
3. Draft a GitHub issue body focused on user story, context, acceptance
   criteria, and out-of-scope.
4. Ask the user before running `gh issue create` or `gh issue edit`, unless the
   user has already agreed to GitHub issue integration for this workflow scope.
5. Store metadata after creation:

```bash
gest task meta set <id> github.issue <number>
gest task meta set <id> github.url <url>
gest task tag <id> github
```

Also attach metadata to the development iteration when applicable.

## GitHub Context From Tags

When promoting work to GitHub, include public-safe tag classification context from `references/tag_dependency_workflow.md` when it helps reviewers understand scope. Do not expose private Gest IDs unless the target repo policy allows them.
