description: Gest Plan. Decompose a spec, outline task, or GitHub-backed initiative into Gest tasks, dependencies, phases, and session/development iterations.

# GPL: Gest Plan

Use to convert a spec or outline task into executable Gest structure.

## Inputs

Accept a Gest artifact ID, task ID, GitHub issue URL/number, or user-described
scope. Read the entity with `gest ... show --json` when possible.

## Gest Memory

Before decomposing work, search Gest for existing parents, sibling tasks,
follow-ups, and related iterations:

```bash
gest search "<scope/topic>" --all --json --limit 20
gest search "Follow-up <scope/topic>" --all --json --limit 20
gest task show <id-or-prefix> --json
gest task note list <id-or-prefix> --json
gest iteration show <id-or-prefix> --json
```

Reuse existing durable parents when they fit. Prefer linking new leaves into
the existing tree over creating a duplicate outline area.

## Decisions

1. Is this a session plan or development plan?
2. What is the outline parent?
3. What depth should new tasks have?
4. Which tasks are independent?
5. Which phases and `blocked-by` links are needed?
6. Which branch model and execution model should write tasks use?
7. Should GitHub metadata be attached?

## Output Structure

Create tasks with native `child-of` links:

- depth 1: `issue`
- depth 2: `subissue` or concrete implementation leaf
- depth 3: tiny subtasks only when useful

Create or update an iteration and add tasks with explicit phases. Tasks in the
same phase must be safe to run concurrently.

For every non-trivial write slice, decide or leave clear metadata placeholders
for:

```text
vcs.tool=git|git-butler|jj
vcs.branch_mode=session-branch|development-branch|stacked-session|stacked-development|parallel-worktrees
vcs.execution=main-worktree|git-worktrees|gitbutler-workspace|jj-workspaces
vcs.parallel_allowed=true|false
vcs.branch=<branch-name>
vcs.workspace_path=<absolute-path>
```

Use stacked branch modes for multiple meaty dependent slices that should be
reviewed separately. Use `parallel-worktrees` only for independent slices that
will run at the same time in separate physical worktrees. Do not plan parallel
write execution inside one GitButler workspace; GitButler stacks and parallel
lanes are sequential curation tools for agents.

Report task IDs, phase grouping, dependencies, and whether `gor` can parallelize
the work.

## Tag And Dependency Planning

Apply `references/tag_dependency_workflow.md` while decomposing work. For every planned leaf, record selected semantic tags and `classification.tags.reviewed=true` metadata. For code-facing phases, list the semantic contracts and `ast-grep` patterns implementers must check. If a tag search reveals coupled surfaces, split or link those surfaces before implementation starts.
